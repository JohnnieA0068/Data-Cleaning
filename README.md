# Data_Cleaning_in_Excel
This is a quick Project I did to show how I am able to present informtion from a Database

First Step   

  I downloaded a raw database .csv file. (Saved As-https://github.com/JohnnieA0068/Data-Cleaning/blob/main/Raw%20Data%20Table%20for%20Cleaning%20Project.xlsx)

Second Step  
  I preformed the following to the .csv file in Excel:
   1)	Get Rid of Extra Spaces
   2)	Select and Treat All Blank Cells
   3)	Convert Numbers Stored as Text into Numbers
   4)	Remove Duplicates
   5)	Highlight Errors
   6)	Change Text to Lower/Upper/Proper Case
   7)	Parse Data Using Text to Column
   8)	Spell Check
   9)	Delete all Formatting
  

This gave a clean, readable Excel DB that can be transformed into Pivot Tables, Chart, and Graphs
